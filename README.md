# Image-Super-Resolution-using-FSRCNN
This project implements a deep learning-based image super-resolution system using the Fast Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (FSRCNN). The goal is to upscale low-resolution images while recovering high-frequency details in an efficient and visually pleasing way
